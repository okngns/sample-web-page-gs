                <p>
                    <em>Galatasaray Spor Kulübü </em> is a pioneer club in Turkish sports history and this characteristic is, without a doubt, comes from the legacy of Galatasaray High School (Mektebi Sultani) which is a pioneer institution that gave birth to our club. The unbreakable bond between the club and the high school is an undeniable reality and a source of pride.
                    <br><br>
                    The school was first founded by Bayezid II in 1481 to educate future statesmen and takes its name from the district it is founded: “Galata Sarayı” (Galata Palace). The school got to its current location on September 1 1868 and it was renovated by Sultan Abdülaziz. With the completion of reconstruction and reorganization, first sporting activities in Turkey started within the school. Gymnast Monsieur Curel added Physical Education class to the syllabus and initiated the activities through education.
                    <br><br>
                    These steps were truly revolutionary for the country: Curel trained the students with modern tools and organized a Training Festival in Kağıthane in 1870. In this event, different athletes with different accomplishments received medals and prizes and students were offered cooked rice (pilaf) with mutton after the contests. This, later, turned into a tradition of its own that brings alumni and students of the school together every year.
                    <br><br>
                    Foreign sports teachers that come to school after Curel (such as M. Moiroux, Signor Martinetti, Stangali) introduced different branches of sports, such as swimming, rowing, apparatus gymnastics, besides gymnastics and track and field. This was also a first in the country. These works gave its first results relatively fast and people like Faik Üstünidman, Major Mazhar Kazancı, Abdurrahman and Ahmet Robenson Brothers, whose names are engraved in Turkish sports history today, worked in the high school and introduced tennis, scouting and hockey to students. Especially with Üstünidman’s leadership, students started to play football for the first time.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite first display of football being nothing but a disorganized, fully chaotic hustle of many students in one field, the game was now inside the historic Ceremonial Gate of the school and the love of football spread like an epidemic.
                    <br><br>
                    Two Englishmen living in İstanbul, James Lafontaine and Horace Armitage founded Kadıköy Football Club on 1901 but on 1903 because of a dispute between English players on the team, Kadıköy FC divided and gave birth to another club: Moda Club. On 1904, these clubs came together with other teams like Imogen, Elpis, Strugglers and founded İstanbul Football Union. They were playing regular games in “Union Club-İttihat Spor” field in İstanbul where Şükrü Saraçoğlu Stadium is on today.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Founders List</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Ali Sami Yen listed thirteen founding members of Galatasaray Spor Kulübü on pages 181 and 182 of Galatasaray Inventory Book as the club’s first chairman from 1905 to 1919.
                    <br><br>
                    According to his almost calligraphic writing, here are the “founding fathers” of Galatasaray:
                    <br><br>
                    1-Ali Sami Yen
                    <br>2-Asım Sonumut
                    <br>3-Emin Bülend Serdaroğlu
                    <br>4-Celal İbrahim
                    <br>5-B. Nikolof
                    <br>6-Milo Bakiş
                    <br>7-Pol Bakiş
                    <br>8-Bekir Sıtkı Bircan
                    <br>9-Tahsin Nahit
                    <br>10-Reşat Şirvanizade
                    <br>11-Hüseyin Hüsnü
                    <br>12-Refik Cevdet Kalpakçıoğlu
                    <br>13-Abidin Daver
                    <br><br>
                    Since there was not an associations law in 1905 in Ottoman Empire, it was not possible for Galatasaray Spor Kulübü to be legally and officially registered. On 1912, after the enaction of Associations Law in the empire, the club finally had a legal identity.

                  <br><br>
                    Galatasaray Sports Club's first official colors were red and white, inspired by the colors of the Turkish flag. However, these colors were met with suspicion by the oppressive and paranoid administration of the period. Fearing the nationalist movement of the time, the footballers were closely monitored by the law enforcement authorities. Later, the colors were changed to yellow and navy, but they were not well-received. Finally, Galatasaray settled on its current symbolic colors of red and yellow.

                  <p>
                    In October 1905, Galatasaray High School student Ali Sami Yen and his friends decided to found a football club during the lesson of Tutor Mehmet Ata Bey.
                    <br><br>
                    Everybody gathered after that lesson in the Grand Cour during recess to play football. However, under Abdülhamid II’s rule, it was illegal for young people to get together, let alone founding sports clubs.
                    <br><br>
                    These conditions brought together the core of the Galatasaray football team.
                    <br><br>
                    In Ali Sami Yen’s words, the bond between the kids in these teams was akin to the bond between Three Musketeers. Sometimes they were insulted, sometimes they were forced to fight to defend themselves, sometimes they were arrested, sometimes they were suspended from the school. But they discovered the force of being committed and loyal to one another.
                    <br><br>
                    In the school, the headmaster Abdurrahman Şeref Bey forbade playing football to protect the windows of the school. Because of false and negative intelligence given to Abdülhamid II about the school and students, football was also forbidden outside the school. Ali Sami Yen and his friends risked incarceration and even exile and kept playing football secretly every week in a different field of İstanbul.
                    <br><br>
                    This routine kept on until the foundation of the club and caused trouble constantly: According to Yen, the headmaster called “the football lovers” of the club every time they were back from a match and interrogated them about the game and matches. But receiving no answer from his students, he would slap every one of them in the face to deter them from the game they love. To no avail.
                    <br><br>
                    Law enforcement officers of the time were also chasing these successful students. They were constantly followed and reported to the authorities.
                    <br><br>
                    Ali Sami Yen and his friends played their first game against a Greek club as an anonymous team. After winning the game 2-0, they were named by the spectators of the match: “The Gentlemen of Galata Palace.”
                    <br><br>
                    Slaps of the headmaster, suspensions by the school, being stalked by agents, the danger of incarceration… None of these could stop or beat the love of football inside the “Gentlemen of Galata Palace.” None of these pressures could stop the birth of Galatasaray Spor Kulübü with these young men.
                    <br><br>
                    Right around these days, Galatasaray received a stroke of luck and Tevfik Fikret was appointed as the headmaster of Galatasaray High School.
                    <br><br>
                    Contrary to the former headmaster, Tevfik Fikret did not pressure football players to avoid the game. In contrast, he helped them as much as he can to facilitate them to create a team and finally, a club. His backing contributed immensely to both the club and the school. Fikret’s revolutionary spirit and Galatasaray’s committed attitude to the game came together and in a short time, Galatasaray’s true identity was built. That’s why Fikret was not only one of the former headmasters of the high school but also the one and only Tutelar chairman of Galatasaray.
